// jQuery Magic
// Intro

// You will make things appear and disappear (and more) with the magic of jQuery!
// This homework is recommended to be done with a Harry Potter theme. But if you are unfamiliar with Harry Potter, that's cool, you can make up all your wizard details.

if (typeof jQuery == 'undefined'){
    console.log('oops! I still have to link my jQuery properly!');
  } else {console.log('I did it! I linked jQuery and this js file!')};
